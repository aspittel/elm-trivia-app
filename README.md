# Elm Trivia App

## Motivation
I have been trying to understand Elm for quite some time. Its super tricky and a totally different way of thinking than normal programming. I tried to be ambitious a couple times and build something big in Elm, but I decided to think smaller and build this trivia app instead.

## Code Style
Elm style! I tried to make it as similar to the documentation as possible.

## Features
I think the CSS is the biggest feature! Other than that, it's pretty basic! Its just a trivia app that keeps score!
